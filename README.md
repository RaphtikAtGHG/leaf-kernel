# Leaf Kernel
*Note: this is a rewrite of the original kernel*

## Compiling
First we need to configure leaf. Thats easy just run:
```bash
./configure <arch>
```

*Example:*
```bash
./configure x86_64
```


Then its time to build it:
```bash
./build <arch>
```

*Example:*
```bash
./build x86_64
```
